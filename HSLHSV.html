    <p color="#6699CC"> This page is dedicated to our final section/topic/subject/thing. This subject is HSL/HSV. This means hue, saturation, and lightness(luminosity) or hue, saturation, value(brightness for hsb). There is a third variety HSI hue, saturation, intensity. These are also based on RGB. This leads me to believe RGB is the most important and all others are not worth learning. But the purpose of HSL/HSV was to be more intuitive than the RGB cube. It finds use in computer graphics, color pickers, and image editing.</p>

    <p>Where as the RGB model uses a cube, the HSL model uses a cutaway cylinder. They can be more convienent than RGB but lack "seperate color-making attributes." HSL has fast computation times but does not have much color complexity. One flaw of the system is that different colors are assigned the same values. Also CIELAB or CIECAM02 are said to accomplish the same goals better.</p>
