    <p>Hexadimal is one of my favorite forms of color when it comes to color in code. It is quick to write but its main downside is that most codes for colors have to be looked except for a few. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Black: #000000</li>
        <li>White: #ffffff</li>
        <li>Red: #ff0000 </li>
        <li>Blue: #0000ff </li>
        <li>Green: #00ff00 </li>
        <li>Yellow: #ffff00 </li>
      </ul>
      <p> While my favorite color in hexadecimal is #6699CC, it doesn't say exactly what color that is unless you understand how hexadecimals work. As a side note #6699CC is Steel blue. After looking further into this topic, I have discorvered that it is very similar to RGB, with 2 digits being asigned colors. While it is easiest to code due to ALL colors being accessible, RGB is more user friendly allowing the user to see that there is x of red y of green and z of blue, Hexadicmal is more coder friendly once understanding is achieved because it requires less code. While typing blue is easier than typing #0000ff, it allows me to control the shade of blue on a very fine scale by changing a single digit.</p>

      <p> Here are the digits used in making hexadecimal colors. The First two digits represent red, the second reepresent green, and the last two represent blue. 00 being no hue and FF being pure color. FF is 15 times more intense than 00. So with my example of #6699CC, there is 66 red, 99 green, CC of blue. Blue is the most abundant color with red being the least. After this I hope hexadecimal colors have become more clear. But the fact that letters and numbers are both used in this math is still confusing even to me. 00x15=FF. Also where hexadimal lacks is that the number 99 is the limit before you have to use letters.</p>
