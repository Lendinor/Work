    <h4 class="navi">My website's topic is about Colors and how they transfer to computers</4>.
      <p class="navi" id="red"> This is the color: Red </p>
      <p class="navi" id="green"> This is the color Green: </p>
      <p class="navi" id="blue"> This is the color Blue: </p>
      <p> These three colors are the heart of RGB. They are also the computer primary colors. RGB is one of many ways colors are represented on a computer.
      <p> For software that allows changing off the RGB values of objects something similar to this:
        <img src="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/GDI-plus/HSLColorSpace/colorpicker.jpg">
      <p> This is a color picker that displays the rgb on the right hand side.
        <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/color/rgb-slider.html"  target="_blank">This is a working example of a RGB Slider.</a>
      <p>The Three Main Ways Computers Represent colors are: RGB, Hexadecimal, and HSL(HLS)/HSV(HSB). HSL/HSV is based on RGB but also represents Light, Value, and Brightness. This page wiill cover RGB. RGB has orgins before computers. It was used for early color photography. Three filters being red, green, and blue-violet, were used to take the same picture. Next a dark room and projector were neccessary. The photos would be overlayed and the image projected would be colored. James Clerk Maxwell was a pioneer in the color photography by creating the "three-color method." Also televisions used RGB before computers. Personal computers originally used composite video. IBM was the first company to use RGB for computers. It was a fourbit system Red, Green, Blue, and Intensity.</p>
      <p>By mixing red, green, and blue, lots of colors can be made. While red and blue are primary colors, green is not. Yet yellow can be achieved by mixing 255 of red with 255 of green. Why this is so I am not positive but I believe it has to do with light working different than paints, dyes, etc. The exact name of this is additive colors. Subtractuve color is with paints. It is subtractive because because you subract a color from another color, making the new color. Additive color is when you add color.</p>
